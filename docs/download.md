Download
========

Binaries for Windows and macOS are available in the
[Github Releases](https://github.com/windowjs/windowjs/releases/latest) page.

{: .strings}
| [windowjs-windows-x64.zip](https://github.com/windowjs/windowjs/releases/latest/download/windowjs-windows-x64.zip) |
| [windowjs-macOS-x64.zip](https://github.com/windowjs/windowjs/releases/latest/download/windowjs-macOS-x64.zip) |

Window.js can be [built](/dev/build) from the [sources](/dev/checkout) for
Windows, macOS and Linux.


**Windows**

Google Chrome and other browsers may issue a warning because the download
isn't a common file. Choose "Keep" to download the zip file.

The current releases are signed and should not trigger a warning from
Windows Defender. Please file an [issue](/about/issues) if Windows shows any
warnings.

Alternatively, `windowjs.exe` can be
[built](/dev/build) from the [sources](/dev/checkout).


**macOS**

Google Chrome and other browsers may issue a warning because the download
isn't a common file. Choose "Keep" to download the zip file.

The current releases are not signed. The first execution of `windowjs` might get
blocked by macOS for this reason. Click "OK" and then open the "Security"
setting in the "System Preferences"; it will mention `windowjs` having been
blocked, and there's a button to "Open" the application.

Alternatively, the `windowjs` binary can be
[built](/dev/build) from the [sources](/dev/checkout).
